In the given dataset we choose only the text and class level to build the model and analyze the SMS. we applied our training data on few classification methods such as Linear SVC, Gaussian and Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes for filtering out the SMS. We evaluated their performances based on Confusion matrix, F1 score and Hamming loss.
